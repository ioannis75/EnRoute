# EnRoute
An app with interactive map of the train route and audio guides about POIs brought to passengers' devices by geofencing

An infotainment platform available to passengers from their own devices (BYOD). Passengers can enjoy an interactive travel guide – a map of the train route with a notification of the POI (Point of Interest) – in the language of their choice. A multi-language audio travel guide is played through passengers' own headphones, for them to have the chance to admire the landscape while gathering all desired information, without being interrupted. With our app TRAINOSE is able to eliminate all printed material, and save valuable time and costs of printing and supplying marketing material to each car of the vehicles. Passengers of TRAINOSE routes also gather history facts and tips on various activities to perform in each station, an overview of their trip and a Real Time Information (RTI) with estimated time of arrival, actual information regarding stops, delays and onboard safety protocols (of particular importance during a pandemic), capable to be dynamically updated.
